# QuickMenu Light

A rofi-style quick action popup for Windows, built entirely in native AutoHotkey v2 — no external dependencies. Press a hotkey, pick an action with the arrow keys, hit Enter — done.

> A second implementation, **QuickMenu** (WebView2-based, custom HTML/CSS UI), is still under active development on the [`development`](https://github.com/zakiburnama/win_QuickMenu/tree/development) branch and isn't shipped here yet.

## How it works

- **AutoHotkey v2** creates a small, borderless, always-on-top window and draws the menu itself out of native `Text` controls — no ListBox, no browser engine, nothing else running in the background.
- Retro pixel-art look: reverse-video selection (inverted background/text) plus a `>` cursor, like an old game or terminal menu. Colors are switchable — see [Color themes](#color-themes) below.
- Up/Down/Enter are caught directly via `Hotkey`/`HotIfWinActive`, scoped to just this window.
- **Launched fresh on demand, with no persistent background process or hotkey listener.** `QuickMenuLight.exe` is launched by Lenovo Vantage's "User Defined Key" feature whenever the assigned key is pressed, shows the popup, runs the chosen action, and exits — nothing lingers in the background between presses.
- Dismisses like a mobile/web popup: **only Up/Down/Enter are "accepted" input** — any other key or clicking outside the popup closes it without running an action. Escape is the one exception: inside the Color Scheme submenu it steps back to the main menu instead of closing outright; pressed again from the main menu, it closes like everything else.

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11
- [AutoHotkey v2](https://www.autohotkey.com/) — to run/edit [quickmenu_light.ahk](quickmenu_light.ahk) or recompile it

That's it — no runtime, no vendored library, no extra font files.

## Actions

Most items are defined in `RunAction()` in [quickmenu_light.ahk](quickmenu_light.ahk:275) — Color Scheme, Reminder, and Cancel Reminder are handled separately (they open a second-level picker instead of firing immediately):

| Menu item | Action |
|---|---|
| Open Terminal | Launches Windows Terminal elevated (`Run("*RunAs wt.exe")`) — triggers a UAC prompt since QuickMenu Light itself runs unelevated |
| Open WezTerm | Launches WezTerm (`Run("wezterm-gui")` — not `wezterm.exe`, see [Gotchas](#gotchas) below) |
| Obsidian | Launches Obsidian via its full path under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Obsidian\` — it's a per-user Electron install, not on PATH (see [Gotchas](#gotchas)) |
| Color Scheme | Opens the theme picker described below |
| Next Wallpaper | Advances the wallpaper by one image, on demand — see [Wallpaper slideshow](#wallpaper-slideshow) below. Same one-shot behavior as Windows' own right-click *Next desktop background*: runs `rotate-wallpaper.ps1` once (hidden, non-blocking) and the popup closes immediately — it doesn't wait around watching it apply |
| Reminder | Opens the duration picker described in [Reminders](#reminders) below |
| Cancel Reminder | Opens a live list of pending reminders to cancel — see [Reminders](#reminders) below |
| Lock PC | Locks the workstation (`LockWorkStation`) |
| Sleep | Suspends the machine (`SetSuspendState`) |
| Close All Windows | Closes every open window (`WinClose` over `WinGetList()`) |

To add or change an item, edit the `baseItems` array and the matching `case` in `RunAction()`.

## Color themes

Selecting **Color Scheme** from the menu opens a submenu of the available themes. Pick one with Up/Down + Enter and it applies **immediately, live** — the submenu stays open so you can flip through a few before settling on one — and is written to `quickmenu_settings.ini` next to the exe, so it's remembered the next time QuickMenu Light opens. Press Escape to step back to the main menu, or Escape again (or any other key, or clicking outside) to close.

| Theme | Look |
|---|---|
| `game_boy` | Classic DMG Game Boy 4-shade green |
| `vintage` | Warm cream paper / dark brown ink |
| `amber` | Amber CRT terminal (black bg, amber text) |
| `green_term` | Phosphor-green CRT terminal |
| `catppuccin-mocha` | Catppuccin Mocha — also restyles nvim/WezTerm/Starship + wallpaper, see [below](#global-themes-nvim--wezterm--starship--wallpaper) |
| `gruvbox` | Gruvbox Dark — also restyles nvim/WezTerm/Starship + wallpaper, see [below](#global-themes-nvim--wezterm--starship--wallpaper) |

To add a new theme, add an entry to the `THEMES` map and its name to `THEME_NAMES` at the top of [quickmenu_light.ahk](quickmenu_light.ahk:13) — it'll show up in the picker automatically. Each theme is `{ bg, fg, selBg, selFg, bezel }`: normal background/text, selected-item background/text (reverse-video, like an old terminal menu highlight), and the window's own background color (shows as a thin border/bezel around the item list) — all hex, no `#` prefix.

The font is the classic Windows raster font `Terminal`, chosen specifically because it renders as blocky pixels at small sizes with zero extra files — change the font name/size in `Render()` if you want something else.

### Global themes (nvim / WezTerm / Starship / wallpaper)

Two of the six entries — `catppuccin-mocha` and `gruvbox` — are **global**: picking one restyles the QuickMenu Light popup like any other theme *and* fans out to the rest of the terminal/editor setup (plus the desktop wallpaper) in one shot. The other four (`game_boy`, `vintage`, `amber`, `green_term`) are retro CRT looks with no natural editor/terminal equivalent, so they stay QuickMenu-only on purpose.

The fan-out is [apply-theme.ps1](scripts/apply-theme.ps1), launched hidden and non-blocking (`Run(..., "Hide")`) from `OnEnter()` whenever the chosen theme is in the `GLOBAL_THEMES` set. It touches four things, all hardcoded machine-specific paths (this is a personal single-user tool, not a portable one):

| Tool | File | How |
|---|---|---|
| Neovim | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Temp\nvim\theme.txt` | Whole-file overwrite with the colorscheme name — the same file `theme.lua` (in the [dotfiles](https://github.com/zakiburnama/dotfiles) repo, `nvim/.config/nvim/lua/config/theme.lua`) reads on startup and writes on every `:colorscheme` change, so this is just "pretend the user ran `:colorscheme x`". Takes effect on next nvim launch, **not** in an already-running session. |
| Starship | `dotfiles/starship/.config/starship.toml` | Replaces the contents between `# BEGIN THEME PALETTE` / `# END THEME PALETTE` markers. The palette table is permanently named `[palettes.active]` (`palette = 'active'` never changes) specifically so the script never has to hunt for a varying table name — it only ever swaps what's *inside* those markers. Static TOML, no live reload: the new prompt appears on the next shell/tab, not the current one. |
| WezTerm | `dotfiles/wezterm/.config/wezterm/wezterm.lua` | Replaces the contents between `-- BEGIN THEME COLORS` / `-- END THEME COLORS` markers with a full new `config.colors = { ... }` block. WezTerm auto-reloads its config on file change, so this one *does* apply live to already-open windows. |
| Desktop wallpaper | `dotfiles/wallpapers/<theme>/` | Sets the desktop wallpaper (Fill style) to the alphabetically-first `.jpg`/`.jpeg`/`.png`/`.bmp` found in that theme's folder, via the `SystemParametersInfo` Win32 API (shared with `rotate-wallpaper.ps1`, see below). Applies live immediately. Drop your own image(s) in `dotfiles/wallpapers/catppuccin-mocha/` and `dotfiles/wallpapers/gruvbox/` — an empty or missing folder is treated as "not set up yet" and silently skipped, not an error. With more than one image in a folder, prefix filenames (e.g. `01-foo.jpg`) to control which one shows first — the pick is always deterministic (alphabetical), never random. |

Adding a third global theme: add an entry to the `$Themes` registry and the `ValidateSet` in `scripts/apply-theme.ps1`, a matching `THEMES`/`GLOBAL_THEMES` entry in `quickmenu_light.ahk`, and a `dotfiles/wallpapers/<theme>/` folder if you want wallpaper support for it too. The marker-delimited approach means the two dotfiles only ever get a wholesale block swap — never partial line edits — so a bad/missing marker fails loudly (`Set-MarkedBlock` throws if it doesn't find exactly one match) instead of silently corrupting the file.

Failures aren't shown anywhere (the script runs with no window) — check `%TEMP%\quickmenu-apply-theme.log` if a global theme pick didn't seem to take effect somewhere.

### Wallpaper slideshow

`apply-theme.ps1` only ever shows the *first* image in a theme's folder. [rotate-wallpaper.ps1](scripts/rotate-wallpaper.ps1) is what cycles through the rest, two ways:
- **Automatically**, every 30 min, via a Windows Scheduled Task (`QuickMenu Light - Wallpaper Rotation`, registered once via [install-wallpaper-rotation.ps1](scripts/install-wallpaper-rotation.ps1)) — it keeps advancing in the background without any process sitting idle in memory between ticks: Task Scheduler briefly spawns `powershell.exe`, it runs for well under a second, and exits.
- **On demand**, via the **Next Wallpaper** menu item — same script, same one-shot run, just triggered by `Run(..., "Hide")` from `quickmenu_light.ahk` instead of Task Scheduler. Picking it doesn't reset or interfere with the 30-min timer; it's the same rotation state (`quickmenu-wallpaper-rotation.json`) either way, so a manual "next" just makes the following scheduled tick advance from wherever you left it.

How it knows what to rotate:
- **Which theme**: `apply-theme.ps1` writes the active theme's name to `%TEMP%\quickmenu-active-theme.txt` every time a global theme is picked. `rotate-wallpaper.ps1` just reads that — it has no idea about `quickmenu_light.ahk` or the `$Themes` registry at all.
- **Which image**: `%TEMP%\quickmenu-wallpaper-rotation.json` remembers `{theme, lastFile}`. Each tick, if the saved theme still matches the active one, it advances to the next file alphabetically (wrapping around at the end); if the theme changed (or the saved filename no longer exists), it restarts at image #1 for the new folder instead of guessing.

Setup (already done once on this machine — only needed again after moving the repo, since the task's action hardcodes the script's path), run from the repo root:
```powershell
.\scripts\install-wallpaper-rotation.ps1
```
To stop it: `Unregister-ScheduledTask -TaskName 'QuickMenu Light - Wallpaper Rotation'`. To check on it: `Get-ScheduledTask -TaskName 'QuickMenu Light - Wallpaper Rotation' | Get-ScheduledTaskInfo` (see `LastTaskResult` — `0` means success) or tail `%TEMP%\quickmenu-apply-theme.log`, which both scripts write to.

The task runs as the current user, not SYSTEM — SYSTEM runs in session 0 and can't touch the interactive desktop's wallpaper, so `Register-ScheduledTask` deliberately leaves `-User`/`-Principal` at its default (current user, standard rights, no elevation needed).

### Reminders

Selecting **Reminder** opens a submenu of fixed durations — `5 min`, `10 min`, `15 min`, `30 min`, `60 min`. Unlike Color Scheme, picking one closes the popup right away instead of staying open — there's no "try a few" use case for a timer. Press Escape to step back to the main menu without setting anything.

Durations are a fixed list, not free text — this app has no text-input control anywhere (no `Edit` box, nothing to type into), and a reminder timer didn't seem worth being the first thing that breaks that. Want a different set of durations? Edit `REMINDER_OPTIONS` in [quickmenu_light.ahk](quickmenu_light.ahk:40) *and* the matching `[ValidateSet(...)]` in [set-reminder.ps1](scripts/set-reminder.ps1) — they have to stay in sync, since the AHK side just strips `" min"` off the chosen label and passes the number straight through.

Picking a duration runs [set-reminder.ps1](scripts/set-reminder.ps1) (hidden, non-blocking, same `Run(..., "Hide")` pattern as everything else here), which:
1. Registers a **one-time** Task Scheduler task (unique name, timestamped, so overlapping reminders don't collide) that fires [show-reminder.ps1](scripts/show-reminder.ps1) at the target time — same "nothing idle in memory while waiting" reasoning as the wallpaper rotation task.
2. Shows an immediate confirmation balloon ("Reminder set for 3:45 PM (10 min)") so you know it actually took, since the popup itself gives no feedback before closing.

When the task fires, `show-reminder.ps1` shows a balloon + beep ("Reminder: 10 minute(s) is up.") and then **unregisters its own task** — Task Scheduler doesn't clean up one-time tasks on its own, so without this step you'd accumulate a stale task per reminder forever.

Reminders survive a restart or sleep — Task Scheduler tasks are stored on disk, not in memory, and `-StartWhenAvailable` (set when the task is registered) means a reminder that should've fired while the machine was off/asleep fires as soon as it's back, instead of being silently skipped.

**Checking what's pending, or cancelling one**: selecting **Cancel Reminder** runs [list-reminders.ps1](scripts/list-reminders.ps1) and shows each pending reminder as `"10 min -> 3:45 PM"` (or `(no reminders set)` if there's nothing pending — picking that does nothing, only Escape backs out). Picking one runs [cancel-reminder.ps1](scripts/cancel-reminder.ps1) with that reminder's exact task name, which `Unregister-ScheduledTask`s it and confirms with a notification.

This is the **one place in the app that waits on PowerShell** instead of firing it hidden/non-blocking — `list-reminders.ps1` has to actually run and return its output *before* the submenu can be sized and drawn, so opening Cancel Reminder has a brief (~0.2–0.4s) delay where the rest of QuickMenu Light is instant. `quickmenu_light.ahk`'s `GetPendingReminders()` gets that output via `ComObject("WScript.Shell").Exec(...).StdOut.ReadAll()` rather than `Run()` — the only spot in this codebase using that pattern.

You can check the same thing manually any time without opening QuickMenu Light: `Get-ScheduledTask | Where-Object { $_.TaskName -like 'QuickMenu Light - Reminder *' }`.

Both scripts log to `%TEMP%\quickmenu-apply-theme.log`, same file every other script here uses.

## Running it

**As a script** (for development/testing) — requires AutoHotkey v2 installed, menu shows immediately on launch:
```
quickmenu_light.ahk
```

**As a compiled exe:**
```
Ahk2Exe.exe /in quickmenu_light.ahk /out QuickMenuLight.exe /base "<path to AutoHotkey64.exe>"
```
Note: Ahk2Exe's argument parser breaks on spaces in `/base` — use the 8.3 short path (e.g. `C:\PROGRA~1\AUTOHO~1\v2\AUTOHO~2.EXE`) if your AutoHotkey install lives under `Program Files`.

`QuickMenuLight.exe` is a genuine single file with no other dependencies — copy it anywhere.

## Wiring it to a hotkey (Lenovo Vantage)

Since the exe has no hotkey listener of its own:

1. Open **Lenovo Vantage** → **Device settings** → **Input** → **User defined key**.
2. Pick the key (e.g. F12), set the action to **Open applications and files**.
3. In the picker, only Start Menu-registered apps are browsable — the exe's real path won't show up directly. Create a shortcut to it inside `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\` first, then it will appear in the list.
4. Select it, save. Pressing the key now launches QuickMenu Light directly — no AHK process runs in between key presses.

## Gotchas

A few non-obvious fixes that shaped this file, in case you're extending it:

- **Centering**: get the window size from `Gui.Show(...)` with explicit `w`/`h`/`x`/`y` computed up front, not from `Show("AutoSize")` followed by `GetPos()`/`Move()` — reading the size back out after an AutoSize show and repositioning afterward isn't reliable (it renders once at the wrong spot first).
- **"Close All Windows" closing nothing**: the popup's own Gui window is itself in `WinGetList()` while it's still open. If it gets `WinClose()`d as part of the loop, that fires the `Close` event and calls `ExitApp()` immediately, cutting the loop short before any *other* window closes. Fix: call `myGui.Destroy()` first — `Destroy()`, unlike `WinClose()`, doesn't fire the `Close` event.
- **`wezterm.exe` is a console-subsystem launcher**, not the GUI app — running it directly leaves a visible console window behind `wezterm-gui.exe` that closes together with the terminal. Launch `wezterm-gui.exe` directly instead.
- **Dismiss-on-blur reentrancy**: our own `guiObj.Destroy()` (called before running the chosen action) synchronously re-triggers `WM_ACTIVATE(inactive)` on that same window, which reenters the very deactivate-handler that's supposed to close the popup on focus loss — and calls `ExitApp()` *before* the actual action (`Run()`, `DllCall()`, ...) executes. Symptom: selecting any item just closed the popup and did nothing else. Fixed with a plain guard: `myGui.Closing := true` right before our own deliberate `Destroy()`, checked by the `WM_ACTIVATE`/`WM_KEYDOWN` handlers before they call `ExitApp()`.
- **Resizing/repositioning an already-visible window with `Gui.Move(x, y, w, h)` (raw numbers) drifted further off-center each time** — needed when switching between the main menu and the Color Scheme submenu, since they have different row counts and therefore different heights. `Gui.Move()` didn't agree with the coordinates `Gui.Show("x# y# w# h#")` (string options) uses for the same window. Fix: call `Show(...)` again instead of `Move()` to reposition — pass `NoActivate` too, so re-showing an already-active window doesn't fire a spurious `WM_ACTIVATE` that the dismiss-on-blur handler above could mistake for real focus loss.
- **`Run("Obsidian.exe")` (bare name) failed silently** — unlike `wt.exe`/`wezterm-gui`, Obsidian isn't a registered PATH alias; as a per-user Electron install it lives under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Obsidian\Obsidian.exe` and nowhere Windows' default search order looks. General rule when adding a new app to the menu: first try `where <name>.exe` in a terminal — if that finds nothing, get the exe's real path either from Task Manager (right-click the running process → *Open file location*) or its Start Menu shortcut (*More → Open file location*, or check the shortcut's *Target*), then `Run()` that full path instead of a bare name.
- **A console window briefly flashed on screen every 30 min** (whenever the wallpaper rotation task fired) even though its action passed `-WindowStyle Hidden` to `powershell.exe`. Root cause: `powershell.exe` is a *console-subsystem* app — Windows creates the console host window (`conhost.exe`) as part of process startup, before PowerShell's own code gets a chance to read `-WindowStyle Hidden` and hide it. That window-creation-then-hide sequencing is what flashes; it's a known PowerShell behavior; see [PowerShell/PowerShell#3028](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/3028). `-Hidden` on `New-ScheduledTaskSettingsSet` does **not** fix this — that setting only controls the task's visibility inside Task Scheduler's own UI, unrelated to the launched process's window. Fix: [run-hidden.vbs](scripts/run-hidden.vbs) — launched via `wscript.exe` (a *GUI-subsystem* app, so no console window is ever created at all) instead of calling `powershell.exe` directly, it re-launches the target script as a genuinely invisible detached process (`WScript.Shell.Run(cmd, 0, False)`). Used by both Task Scheduler-triggered scripts ([install-wallpaper-rotation.ps1](scripts/install-wallpaper-rotation.ps1), and the one-time task [set-reminder.ps1](scripts/set-reminder.ps1) registers) — not needed for anything QuickMenu Light launches directly via AHK's `Run(..., "Hide")`, since that wasn't where the reported flashing was coming from.
- **Cancel Reminder closed the whole popup instead of opening**: `GetPendingReminders()` originally used `ComObject("WScript.Shell").Exec(...)` + `StdOut.ReadAll()` to run `list-reminders.ps1` synchronously and capture its output. Unlike `.Run()`, WSH's `.Exec()` method has **no window-hiding option at all** — the spawned `powershell.exe` console was always visible, if briefly. That window stealing the foreground fired `WM_ACTIVATE(inactive)` on the QuickMenu popup, which the dismiss-on-blur handler (`CloseOnDeactivate`, see above) correctly-but-unhelpfully read as "user clicked away" and closed the popup with `ExitApp()` — before `GetPendingReminders()` even returned. Symptom: click Cancel Reminder, a `powershell.exe` window flashes, the whole popup vanishes instead of showing the list. Fix: `list-reminders.ps1` now writes its output to a file (`%TEMP%\quickmenu-pending-reminders.txt`) instead of stdout, and `GetPendingReminders()` reads it back via `RunWait(cmd, , "Hide")` + `FileRead()` — the same `Run()`/`RunWait()` `"Hide"` mechanism already proven to work everywhere else in this app, which `.Exec()` simply doesn't offer.
